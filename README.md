# CS-330-Comp-Graphics-Visualization
In this project I modified source code to render my computer setup, and other items I typically have on my desk.


How do I approach designing software?
Working on this project has helped me refine my approach to software design, particularly in translating real-world objects into a computationally modeled scene. I have developed new skills in planning object hierarchies, defining spatial relationships, and selecting appropriate materials and lighting to achieve a realistic outcome. My design process began with identifying key objects to include, followed by rough placement sketches and consideration of how each item interacts with light and perspective. I iteratively adjusted object placement and material properties to ensure balance, visual appeal, and realism. These tactics — careful planning, iterative refinement, and attention to technical constraints — are transferable to future projects, whether I am designing a software interface, creating simulations, or modeling interactive systems. Understanding how small design choices affect user perception and system behavior is a skill I will carry into all future development work.

How do I approach developing programs?
During the development of my 3D scene, I used several new strategies to manage complexity and ensure correctness. Iteration played a critical role; for example, adjusting the pencil’s position on the C book or fine-tuning the metallic material of the water bottle required repeated testing and modification. I developed a habit of building and testing one object or feature at a time, which allowed me to isolate problems and prevent errors from propagating through the scene. Over the course of the project, my approach to developing code evolved to become more structured and methodical. Early milestones taught me the importance of modularity, clean code organization, and careful debugging. By the time I completed the final scene, I had incorporated a workflow of planning, incremental implementation, testing, and refinement, which greatly improved both the quality and efficiency of my development process.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computational graphics and visualization have provided me with new knowledge and basic skills that extend beyond creating aesthetically appealing scenes. Technically, I have gained knowledge of 3D transformations, material and lighting manipulation, and debugging in a programming environment, which can be applied to other software engineering tasks. Conceptually, I have learned to translate real-world problems into computational models, a skill that will aid me in future academic projects and research. Professionally, these visualization skills have practical applications in areas such as simulation, interface design, and interactive software development. Understanding how to craft realistic digital environments strengthens both my problem-solving abilities and my capacity to communicate complex ideas visually. By combining computational thinking with creative design, I am better prepared to develop software that is both technically sound and visually effective, advancing my goals in computer science and technology-related fields.
